# Privacy policy

Last update: 25 February 2023

This site collects no personal data and contains no components that track people's visits.

If I ever decide to implement web analytics, I will use privacy-preserving analytics and explain how I use them here. If possible, I will provide an opt-out link as well.

If anything ever changes, I will update this policy.
