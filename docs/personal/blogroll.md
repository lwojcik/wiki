# Blogroll

Separate section of my bookmarks devoted to blogs that drew my attention.

In 2000s and 2010s I used RSS and Google Reader to follow blogs. These days I can't find a reader that fits the reality of consuming internet on multiple devices and [doesn't turn into shit at some point](https://www.pcmag.com/news/feedly-faces-backlash-over-protest-tracking-ai-models).
