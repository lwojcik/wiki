# Apple iPhone 3GS

- I bought it from the first owner, owned for about a year around 2011-2012, sold to somebody else via Allegro
- ran iOS 6
- It was heavily worn but the quality of materials made it way more resilient than I ever needed
- I enjoyed its soapbox-like form factor
- Despite being out-of-date at the time, it was holding better than any Android smartphone of its age at the time
- As reported by an owner of a current-gen iPhone at the time, my 3GS felt way slower than their iPhone. Having used Android devices it didn't bother me much
- iOS was still in the era of skeuomorphic design - Android never looked like that at that time. Windows Phone with its tile-based UI design was yet to emerge
- I launched GTA III on it. The game was perfectly playable but I don't enjoy playing this kind of video games on a touch screen
- Thanks to owning it I was able to secure easy-to-remember username for my iCloud account and enjoyed having access to it long before I got a MacBook
