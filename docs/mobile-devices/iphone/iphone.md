## Personal notes

- I don't consider iOS superior or inferior to Android
- I prefer Android but I do not rule out the possibility of moving to iOS any time in the future
  - for now I don't see the value in switching between ecosystems after years of using one and being happy with it 
- I recognize iPhones as sligtly more secure but not as privacy-focused as Apple wants people to believe
- I consider iPhones overpriced for what they offer, even their 'low-end' devices are way too expensive to my taste
- I appreciate Apple for supporting their devices for 5-7 years of support unlike most manufacturers of Android smartphones
