## Personal notes

- I currently use both Android and iOS but I don't have clear preference
- I recognize iPhones as sligtly more secure but not as privacy-focused as Apple wants people to believe
- I consider iPhones overpriced for what they offer, even their 'low-end' devices are way too expensive to my taste
- I appreciate Apple for supporting their devices for 5-7 years of support unlike most manufacturers of Android smartphones
