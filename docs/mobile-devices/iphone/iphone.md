# iPhone

Line of smartphones produced by Apple since 2007.

## Personal notes

- I don't consider iOS superior or inferior to Android
- I consider iPhones overpriced for what they offer, even their 'low-end' devices are way too expensive to my taste
- I appreciate Apple for supporting their devices for 5-7 years of support unlike most manufacturers of Android smartphones

## iPhones I used to own

- [iPhone 3GS](./3gs/)
