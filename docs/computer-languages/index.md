# ðŸ“œ Computer Languages

Formalized sets of instructions and syntax rules intended to facilite building computer programs (applications).

Computer languages can be:

- **interpreted** - code is evaluated and executed at the very moment computer reads it
- **compiled** - computer transforms code into a form it understands, links it with external libraries and produces a binary blob that is then executed

Another classification of computer languages I like:

- **high-level** - code is relatively easy to read, write and understand by human but it needs to be processed by a computer before it can be ran
- **low-level** - code is more similar to a real code used by a computer - instead of operating on abstractions, it involves manual operations on memory structures and locations directly on computer chips. A side effect is that low-level code is not easy to read or write by hand

We usually call a language **a programming language** if a machine employing it can resolve any computational problem regardless of its complexity. We also call these languages **Turing-complete**, i.e. capable of creating so-called universal Turing machine. A Turing machine can resolve any problem regardless of the amount of effort needed to build one.

## Additional remarks

- HTML is not a programming language. It's a format that represents certain data structure (usually a website) with a set of predefined syntax rules
- certain elements of CSS can make it _look like_ a Turing complete language, but the language itself is not [^1]
- certain features of SQL make it _undeniably_ Turing complete[^2] and hence it's considered a programming language

## Languages I use productively

Languages that are my usual my tool of choice for getting things done, mostly in a commercial setting. I also include subsets of existing languages because for an untrained eye they may look like a separate language.

- JavaScript
- TypeScript

## Languages I'm familiar with

Languages I'm capable of reading but I don't use them at the moment. I am capable of picking them up and use productively in short time. I may even have built things with them.

- Python
- Java

## Languages I recognize

Languages I may have learnt from online tutorials, but I don't consider myself knowledgeable at them. I recognize their syntax when I see it. I consider them less familiar to me than ones mentioned above.

- PHP
- Ruby
- SQL

## Languages I used to know

Languages that, at some point, I was learning and building things with but I no longer use them in any capacity. I may still be able to recognize their syntax. Picking them up again would require effort or may not be possible at all.

- Atari BASIC
- C++
- C#
- Pascal

## Languages I never used

Languages I never wrote a single line of but I recognize their names. I may not be able to recognize their syntax though.

- assembly
- Brainfuck
- C
- Cobol
- F#
- Fortran
- Go
- Haskell
- Kotlin
- Lisp
- Objective-C
- Rust
- Swift
- Perl
