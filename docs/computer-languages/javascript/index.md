# JavaScript

- interpreted programming language
- high level, dynamic, weakly typed
- multi-paradigm
- created by Brendan Eich in 1995 as a scripting language for Netscape Navigator web browser
  - initially Brendan Eich was hired to embed Scheme language into Navigator
  - Netscape also considered embedding Sun's Java language
  - eventually Eich was asked to create a language with syntax similar to Java
  - the language was briefly called LiveScript, but it was renamed to JavaScript
  - **development done in 10 days! :O**
- developed to this day, follows ECMAScript standard

Can be used in a few ways:

- in web browsers, either as a scripting language to add extra features or build whole in-browser applications
- as language for mobile and desktop applications with the use of React Native or Electron
- with Node.js:
  - as a scripting language for command line
  - as a server language for application backends
- with any device that utilizes a JavaScript engine of any sort (e.g. Bangle.js)
