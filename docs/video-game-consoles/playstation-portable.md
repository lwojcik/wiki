# PlayStation Portable

- bought it second-hand in early 2010s, sold it away a year or two later
- played GTA: Vice City Stories and LittleBigPlanet on it
  - also tried the demo of God of War: Chains Of Olympus but I didn't like it
- PS Vita was already a thing, so PSP was heavily outdated already
- a lot of games to choose from, but not many new releases
  - I even found a physical shop in Warsaw that traded second-hand PSP games
  - it wasn't partially as popular as Nintendo Switch is around me in 2023
    - and I'm saying that in a country where Nintendo spends as little marketing budget as possible
- lighter and smaller than Nintendo Switch, very convenient to use on public transport
- 480x272 4.3" screen
  - at roughly similar time, I used LG Swift which had 320x480 3" screen
  - subjectively PSP screen didn't feel that bad
  - and since it was a gaming console, gameplay mattered much more than image fidelity
- used proprietary disc format called UMD and supported Sony's take on memory cards: Memory Stick
  - PSP and my Sony Ericsson phones were the only devices I ever used that memory card format with ever
- it didn't get me hooked as much as Nintendo Switch did, perhaps the fact it was a dying platform had to do with it
  - I knew of PS Vita at the time but I didn't find it compelling enough to get into
    - And unlike these dayas, in early 2010s I couldn't afford having something as niche and obscure as portable gaming console
