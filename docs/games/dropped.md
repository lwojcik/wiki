# Dropped

I consider the game **dropped** if I started it AND any of the below applies:

- I stopped playing it with clear intention of not picking up again
- the game didn't have clear point of finish and I stopped coming back to it
- the game had clear point of finish (e.g. story mode) but I never reached it

In most cases I'm not keen on revisting titles from this list as I'll likely learn of what I missed from Twitch or YouTube, but exceptions happen. At any given moment of time there is at least one game I'd rather play instead of revisiting anything from this list.
