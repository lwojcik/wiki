# ðŸŽ¥ Videography

The art of video production.

I recently picked up interest in it. It reuses a lot of photography knowledge and opens posibilities photography doesn't offer.

I typically use smartphone cameras as well as various supplementary tools (gimbal, extra lens, filters, tripods). I aim at producing pieces with cinematic quality rather than documenting what I see.

I stick to smartphones rather than any form factor camera so that I don't draw attention to myself.
