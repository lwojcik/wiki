# Pegasus MT-777DX

- Bought by my parents in mid 1990s
- I played on it for a few years until I got a [PC in 1998](../computers/custom-pc-1998.md)
- Massively popular for many years in my area due to reasonable price and wide variety of games
- Considered 'cult' up to these day
- Produced in Taiwan and imported to Poland by BobMark International
- Gaming console belonging to a class of devices called 'Famiclones':
  - Visually resembling Japanese variant of NES called Famicom
  - Not licensed by Nintendo
  - Apparently it could launch Famicom games and some NES games with an adapter but I never had any original Famicom / NES cartridge to confirm that
- Game cartridges were mostly bootleg and very cheap to buy
  - Original Nintendo games had Nintendo branding erased
  - Most cartridges were cheeky compilations consisting of 168 / 10000 / 99999 games in 1
    - The real number was around 5-10 and the remaining ones were modified versions (e.g. 99 lives etc.)
- a Pegasus-compatible copy of NES zapper was also available
- cheap Chinese successors of Pegasus, usually based on a single chip and using the cheapest plastic possible, can still be bought in my country

## Personal notes

- Nintendo was never present in Poland to such extent as in the USA or Western Europe
  - and to this day they maintain minimal presence here unlike Microsoft or Sony, as if central / Eastern Europe was a meteor crater
  - which creates a funny situation: I'm familiar with Nintendo games and they built a lot of my childhood but I do not credit that to Nintendo
- Pegasus and bootleg cartridges are the sole reason I'm familiar with so many NES games despite never owning an original NES
