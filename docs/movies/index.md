# Movies

Films, movies, whatever - moving pictures, right?

For notes on Polish movies I watch, see the section ðŸ‘‰ [Filmy](../pl/filmy/index.md)

## Personal notes

- I don't pay much attention to this medium
- Most of the films I watch via streaming, either on TV or a tablet
  - I believe good film stays good regardless of a medium it is played back on
  - I'm not a fan of cinemas (exceptions do happen)
- I certainly don't care about 'mainstream' cinematography
  - ...and I also don't mind watching truly good films long after their release
