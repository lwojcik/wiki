# The Green Border (2023)

- watched on 23 September 2023 (day after the release)
- directed by Agnieszka Holland, co-produced by Poland, Czech Republic, France and Belgium
- it is based on real events it tells a fictional story happening during Belarus-EU border crisis
- vocally criticized by Polish government as anti-Polish and throwing shade and Polish police and border guards
  - yet no one from the government who expressed their opinion (including the president) watched it beforehand
  - the government announced cinemas would be force to run a warning spot before the screenings, yet I saw none
    - and I doubt cinemas will play it
  - if the government reacts so vocally to a thing before it even hits the public, then the thing is probably truthful
  - and in case of this movie - even if only 5-10% of the movie is truthful, it still send a very grim message about us, Poles
- Maciej Stuhr delivers a powerful rant on Polish government that made the audience laugh with sympathy and clap.
  - until then I never saw an audience clapping to a movie scene
