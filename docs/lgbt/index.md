# 🏳️‍🌈 LGBTQIA+

Assorted resources on LGBTQIA+.

‘LGBTIQA+’ is an evolving acronym that stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, queer/questioning, asexual, and many other terms (such as non-binary and pansexual) that people use to describe their experiences of their gender, sexuality and physiological sex characteristics.

I'm privileged to be a white cisheteric man that never had doubts or problems about any part of that description. But I'm open to learning and taking small steps towards allyship.
