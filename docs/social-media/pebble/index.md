On 24 October 2023 Pebble was announced to shut down on November 1st. The following statement was sent by email:

> We have some sad news to share with you today: as of November 1, 2023, Pebble will be shutting down.
>
> We are immensely proud of what our team and our community have accomplished together, and we feel validated that our vision for Pebble proved true: that purposeful growth, supported by a deep commitment to safety, can foster a beautiful online community full of vibrant human connection.
>
> The painful truth, however, is that we were not growing quickly enough for investors to believe that we will break out. Combine that with a crowded space of alternatives - and the uphill climb is even steeper. In order to continue to build out a complete Pebble, we would have needed more investment, and more time.
>
> Over Pebble’s final days, we are turning our attention to serving those who’ve supported us: friends, family, investors, and you -- our community. We are looking for ways to keep you connected with each other, but perhaps in a different form. Stay tuned for more on this.
