# Bluesky

Assorted stuff about Bluesky, a decentralized invite-only social media platform based on AT Protocol, currently in private beta.

Profile URLs have the following format: `username.bsky.social` (or presumably: `username.bluesky-instance.example.org`).

Originated in Twitter in 2021. Current CEO is Jay Graber. Jack Dorsey, former Twitter CEO is in the board of directors.

To obtain access an invite code is needed. Users receive one code every 2 weeks.

Want an invitation code? While I can't guarantee having one right away, don't be shy - try [contacting me](https://lukaszwojcik.net/contact/).
