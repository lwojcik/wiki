# Bluesky

Assorted stuff about Bluesky, a decentralized invite-only social media platform based on AT Protocol, currently in private beta.

Profile URLs have the following format: `username.bsky.social` (or presumably: `username.bluesky-instance.example.org`).

Originated in Twitter in 2021. Current CEO is Jay Graber. Jack Dorsey, former Twitter CEO is in the board of directors.

Until mid February 2024 it required invite codes to log in. Existing users would get one every 2 weeks.
