# My Political Compass

I'm aware of opinions that the political compass is so imprecise it should be considered as a meme. However, it's proven to be a nice conversation starter and I see value in it as a thought-provoking exercise followed by reflection on current state on politics in my country.

Test taken on: 25 February 2023.
