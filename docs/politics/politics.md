# Politics

Set of beliefs and activites revolving around groups of people, including power relations, resource distributions, decision making and more. The way groupsÂ of people organize themselves and solve common problems.

## Personal notes

- I live in a country where [Overton window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window) makes moderately leftist ideas about human rights more radical than they really are
- Over the years I've been slowly moving from centre to the left
