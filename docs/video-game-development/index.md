# Video Game Development

Processes, approaches, techniques and tools related to video game development. Commonly referred to as **gamedev**.

Video game development is a specific type of software development. Numerous concepts from other computer areas (programming, architecture, design, security) remain relevant to video games.

However, games are substantially different from other types of software. They deal with different categories of problems. They use different languages and different tools.

I'm a web developer. I don't know much about video game development. Only briefly I worked in a startup building a game. I'm unlikely to dive deeply into the topic any time soon.

Nonetheless, I'll share the little I know about it soon.
