# Custom desktop PC (1998)

- Bought in [Lublin](https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=lublin) by my parents in 1998 for 3690 PLN[^1]
- Used mostly by me until mid 2000s when it turned out not powerful enough to access the internet
- Specs:
  - Pentium 200MMX
  - 32 MB RAM
  - graphics card: S3 Virge DX 2 MB
- Came with a set of accessories:
  - generic membrane keyboard
  - generic external speakers
  - CRT monitor: LG Studioworks 57i
  - ink-jet printer: Lexmark 1000
- Sold without an operating system, later I used Windows 95 on it
- Used mostly for learning English and browsing through multimedia encyclopedia-like applications distributed on CD-ROMs
- It was too weak to run many newer games of its time, especially due to graphics card being outdated. It was an era when GPUs were getting more and more powerful, with 3Dfx Voodoo being all the rage
  - [CD Action](https://cdaction.pl/), the gaming magazine I read at the time used color code to denote which of the games on their CD used Voodoo graphics card:
    - red for games requiring it
    - green for those that could do without it
    - yellow not utilizing it at all
  - 'Red' games nearly never worked on that PC and 'green' games were hit-or-miss
