- plugged to any of the kinescope TVs available at home at the time
  - in the end of its life I got a 14-inch Junost 402b black-and-white TV to use exclusively as a display
- had plenty of game compilations on casettes, but games needed time to load
  - and there was no guarantee they would load successfully at all
- I learnt basics of BASIC programming language with it
  - but I never got into advanced structures like graphic modes, DATA commands or assembly language
- It was bought in the era when 8-bit computers were outdated even for the standards of my country
  - at the time, some of my schoolmates had Amigas and some of them had PCs, but neither of them were prevalent yet
