# ðŸ’» Computers

General term for machines that:

- accept human input and process it
- enable humans to **program** them, i.e. allow for modification of their behavior by accepting sets of pre-written instructions (we humans call these 'programs' or 'applications')
- produce a desired result in a form acceptable, understandable and usable by a human

In everyday life I use the notion of **personal computer** and by that term I understand any general purpose device that has data storage, physical keyboard, operating system that allows me to run various applications to get things done and either of the following: built-in screen or an option to plug into an external display.

I've been using the term 'PC' since mid 1990s, mostly to describe a desktop computer. These days, with ubiquity of laptops, I consider both desktops and laptops PCs.

I acknowledge [mobile devices](../mobile-devices) and [wearable devices](../wearable-devices) are specific types of computers, but I treat them as separate category of devices for convenience.
