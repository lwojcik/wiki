# In progress

This list contains games that:

- have story mode with a clear point of finish, I haven't reached it and I'm on my way
- don't have a clear point of finish (e.g. multiplayer games) but I frequently come back to them

Sorted alphabetically.

- Coffee Talk Episode 2
- Lumines Remastered - trying to unlock endless mode, I miss just one skin
- Red Dead Redemption - single player campaign
- Tetris (Game Boy) - considering speedrunning, we'll see
- Tetris 99 - speedrunning 150-line mode for fun
- Tetris Effect: Connected - speedrunning journey mode for fun
