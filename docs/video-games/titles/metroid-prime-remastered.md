# Metroid Prime Remastered

- I never played the original Metroid Prime
- pre-ordered a physical copy
- played about 30 minutes
- somehow I missed a save station and I died during the escape sequence on the space pirate frigate
  - the game put me back at the beginning and played the intro sequence again with no option to skip it
    - btw, why are unskippable video sequences _still_ a thing in 2020s? 
  - I effectively 'rage quit' it and I'm unlikely to pick it up again
- even though I get why this game is such a big deal, I simply do not like it
  - I don't like playing FPS games on consoles
    - I'm saying that after years of using keyboard and mouse for that
    - I don't feel comfortable using thumb sticks for operating camera
    - I don't get the argument 'but it's not an ordinary FPS' by long-time Metroid fans
  - I don't like boss fights
    - especially against bosses I have no emotional attachment to
      - if a boss is simply an obstacle on my way and there's no deeper meaning to killing it, I'm likely to find it frustrating 
    - I simply dislike the whole design pattern of fighting some bullet sponge, dying, learning its movement patterns, trying again, etc.
      - I personally don't find it enjoyable (that applies to Cuphead and Dark Souls too btw)
      - effectively, every single boss fight in every single game looks exactly the same, nothing innovative happens in this department since decades 
    - Metroid Prime starts with one pretty much immediately and that means there will be more
      - and their level of difficulty will likely raise over time
  - right off the bat Metroid Prime fills me with anxiety rather than curiosity and that's not what I expect my games to do
    - I don't play horror games either. I may watch streamers playing this kind of games just fine, but that is not a genre I want to play myself 
    - for a strange reason I had no anxiety playing Metroid Dread - and that game had its own stressful moments 
  - a lot of the points above are not criticisms targeted at the game itself - it's just what I generally dislike about video games I pick up
- I have no nostalgia towards Metroid franchise even though the lore itself I find interesting 
  - I never experienced the original Prime on its original platform, with tech limitations of the time
  - even if remaster remains faithful to the original, it's still a game that uses language, paradigms and assumptions I may not find enjoyable in today's landscape
  - this is another game that solidifies my opinion that Nintendo's business model is monetizing on nostalgia of its fans
