# The Crew: Motorfest

- I played the closed beta in July 2023, then subscribed for a month of Ubisoft+ in September 2023 to check it out
- Enjoyed it overall
- It's very similar to Forza Horizon 5, but it still retains a lot of its own personality known previous The Crew titles
- set on an island of Hawaii
- much more interesting map than in Forza Horizon 5 - it's not as flat and dull
  - the map in TC:M isn't used for Eliminator mode, so it can be much more varied
  - streets are wider
  - rally raids (equivalent of cross-country races) are more interesting as terrain is more varied
  - cities and urban architecture is present
- car selection is similar to FH5, but there are also bikes and boats
  - I found a few cars I didn't see in FH5 (e.g. concept cars)
- bikes are tons of funs, especially in rally raids
- playlists are built differently than in FH5
  - more events and more varied
  - racing events are longer (anywhere between 2-10 minutes)
  - photo opportunities, collectibles and feats (skills) are parts of playlists
- most playlists (as of September 2023) involve cars and bikes
  - there is one playlist for boats
- great game for cruising overall
- not the greatest game for racing per se:
  - opponent AI is just as bad as in Forza Horizon titles
  - rubberbanding is atrocious
  - driving model is better than in The Crew 2, but it's still very weird
  - drifting physics makes no sense and cars are poorly tuned for that - without drifting assist I couldn't even get the most basic powersliding to work
  - cars don't handle well while cornering
  - braking lines are virtually useless and in many cases completely invisible
- good game, but too expensive, both for the release price ($70) and as a subscription (~$15)
