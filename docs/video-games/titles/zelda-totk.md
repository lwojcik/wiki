# The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom

- I'm highly unlikely to buy the game for now
  - sticking to Twitch streams to see if the game is any good
- I like Zelda franchise, but I'm too new to this fandom to have any emotional attachment to it
- [with a few expections, I don't like fantasy](https://offbeatbits.com/4-months-in-hyrule-but-is-the-world-my-oyster/#i-dont-like-fantasy-games)
