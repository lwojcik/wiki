# The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom

- Not planning to play the game for now
- Watched dozens of hours no-commentary playthroughs on YT or streamers playing it
- The fact this game was possible to happen on Nintendo Switch is nothing short of amazing
- Stuff I didn't like about BotW is still in TotK
- Story is once again very cliche and it's interesting only on first playthrough
- Gameplay mechanics didn't get me hooked enough to try the game myself
- [I mostly don't like fantasy](https://offbeatbits.com/4-months-in-hyrule-but-is-the-world-my-oyster/#i-dont-like-fantasy-games)
  - TotK blurs the line between fantasy and science-fiction but I still consider it more of a fantasy than SF
