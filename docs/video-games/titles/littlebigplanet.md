# LittleBigPlanet

- I played the demo of it somewhere in 2010s on [PlayStation Portable](../../video-game-consoles/playstation-portable.md)
- very charming and good looking platformer
- since PSP was my only Sony console ever, I don't know what happened to the franchise
  - after selling PSP away I never heard about it again
