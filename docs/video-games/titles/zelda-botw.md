# The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild

One of my first games on [Nintendo Switch](../../video-game-consoles/nintendo-switch.md).

- [Read my blog post on Offbeat Bits](https://offbeatbits.com/4-months-in-hyrule-but-is-the-world-my-oyster/#i-dont-like-fantasy-games)
  - tl;dr:
    - the game was quite a bumpy ride at first
    - the story is mediocre
    - I don't like fantasy games
    - but I liked this game for many reasons
- I have no prior Zelda experience
  - I played the original Zelda from NES for a few minutes
  - in general, I don't find this franchise enjoyable enough to go through older games
  - that also means I have no nostalgia, emotional attachments or strong opinions on BOTW compared to the previous games in the series
- I didn't complete 100% of it, no plans of doing so
  - did the whole story, all shrines, ~99% of side missions and I forgot how many Korok seeds
  - no intention of going back for now
- I didn't buy a DLC, no plans of doing so
  - I saw it on Twitch streams and I don't find it enjoyable to play myself
