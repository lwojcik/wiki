# STAY

- Released by Appnormals Team in 2018
- story-based escape room video game
- I played on Nintendo Switch in March 2023, completed it within one evening
- okay, "completed" is a bit of an overstatement, but I stick to it
  - I saw one out of 7 endings (took around 5-6 hours + 30-minute downtime)
- I loved the concept
  - I loved how devs were poking around the 4th wall by showing stats of other players' choices
  - It's dark and horrorish but still believable
  - gives me Black Mirror: Bandersnatch vibes
  - soundtrack really sets the mood
- However, the execution is lackluster and the game quickly becomes annoying
  - riddles are poorly designed
    - some of them feel very out of place and add nothing to the story
    - some of them are impossible to get through without exlanations / tutorials on YouTube
      - also, the game has very stupid generic title and it's nearly impossible to search anything about it (Google keeps thinking I made a typo in 'Stray')
    - some of the riddles are randomized, so each forced reset can nullify a lot of progress
    - I went through them once, but that
  - the game reset my gameplay a few times due to poor internet connectivity
    - I put switch
  - controls in Nintendo Switch port are unintuitive and frustrating, especially in handheld mode
    - no option to speed up dialogues on subsequent replays
  - a lot of stuff in the game was clearly designed for achievements
    - which aren't a thing on Nintendo Switch
    - but that's a problem of many games when studios porting them don't think criticially
  - unskippable credits
  - all 7 endings are in fact exact same ending with minor details changed
    - which means all choices in the game are in fact meaningless
  - excess usage of Latin quickly turned my curiosity off
  - I have no intention of replaying the game so I don't know what's the deal with counting time
    - And with my the way I play games on Switch (infrequently and in short bursts), I don't allow games to organize my time
