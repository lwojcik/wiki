# Pikmin 4

- finished in August 2023, played for ~50 hours
- completed ~90% of game content
  - didn't complete Olimar's Shipwreck Tale (played through it but couldn't be bothered to try again) or any content that is locked behind its completion
- super fun exploration from a very unique point of view
- Dandori battles and challenges are great
- great game overall, but...
  - I hated Engulfed Castle with passion
  - after the first 'ending' the game loses a lot of its momentum
  - I caught myself multiple times thinking 'are we there yet? Please?' 
  - final sequence needlessly dragged to the point of frustration (final cave consists of 20 levels and a multi-stage boss fight - I cursed a lot while playing through this nonsense)
- even though I enjoy the franchise and all Pikmin installments are available on Nintendo Switch, I have no plans of playing them for now
