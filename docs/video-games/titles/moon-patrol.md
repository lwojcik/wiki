# Moon Patrol

- One of the first video games I ever played on [Atari XE](/computers/atari-65xe.md)
- my copy had corrupted music and for many years I thought it was supposed to be that way
  - it had to do with wrong conversion of the game from a different ROM
  - my copy was on a bootleg casette tape compilation
