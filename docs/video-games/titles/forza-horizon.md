# Forza Horizon

- Got a physical copy, completed on Xbox Series X in early 2023
- Aged reasonably well, but the graphics is a little dated and it runs in 30fps :(
  - I saw people emulating it but I never dug into it
- Online component missing, expansion packs aren't available any more
- Super nostalgic journey
  - unlike modern installments, the game had fully fledged story and a memorable villain
    - and we play as an ordinary festival participant rather than uber-boss, hence we have to work our way up
  - there's something emotional about seeing where it all began
  - real life references, real companies acting as 'sponsors'
  - the whole festival vibe feels very convincing
- mostly racing events (which I didn't mind)
  - no offroad - free roaming outside of roads is not possible except a few open areas
  - a few rally races are present-
    - but just like in other installments, rally usually means 90% asphalt, 10% dirt
    - speed traps and speed zones available
      - traffic isn't ghosted so they're a bit frustrating to do if you played Forza Horizon 4
  - a few things to do involve drifting but cars are very poorly tuned for that
- perhaps the most memorable soundtrack in the whole franchise that elevates this game to a completely different level
  - Porter Robinson - Language
    - game menu song
  - Rusko - Everyday (Netsky VIP Remix)
    - introductory racing song
    - don't confuse it with Netsky Remix (without the VIP part), which sounds similar, but doesn't have the same vibe
  - Avicii - Levels (Skrillex Remix)
    - one of the songs used in the introductory cut scene
  - Benny Benassi - Cinema (Skrillex Remix)
  - Blind Faith ft. Liam Bailey - Chase and Status (No More Idols)
  - Digitalism - Encore
  - DJ Fresh ft. Dizzee Rascal - The Power
  - Modestep - Show Me A Sign
  - Mord Fustang - Lick The Rainbow
  - New Order - Blue Monday 88
  - Rusko - Somebody To Love (Sigma Remix)
  - and MANY more
