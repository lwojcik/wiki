# How to get better at racing games

Typically applies to car simulators and simcades. Arcade racing games are usually too specific to discuss them here.

- for most of the time your vehicle can do only one thing well out of the following:
  - braking
  - turning
  - accelerating
- for most of the time try to do only one thing at once
  - if you brake and turn at conce, you risk spinning out
  - if you brake and accelerate at once, you may have trouble turning
  - if you accelerate and turn - you may have trouble hitting the apex of the turn
  - you can try doing two things at once only if you know your car well
- if your game allows for that - learn manual transmission
  - it gives you the most degree of control over your vehicle
    - by downshifting, you can get an effect of engine braking before sharp turns
    - by upshifting, you can reduce available engine power and save yourself from spinning out
  - automatic transmission doesn't always switch gears at optimal engine RPM
    - in some games the sole fact of using manual transmission makes player way faster than another player using automatic transmission
- you have one substantial resource to manage: **traction**
  - traction involves the degree to which your wheels contact the ground
  - traction is affected by how your car is designed and how much downforce it gets
  - different tyres give different degrees of traction
  - you lose traction if your wheels lose contact with the ground
    - and that happens often while braking, turning or accelerating
  - in some cases (e.g. rally racing), you can take turns faster by losing traction in a controlled way (often called powersliding)
  - traction constrol assist ensure you won't spin out if you add too much throttle but it also makes you slower at times
- cars can be described in a few ways:
  - by drive type:
    - rear-wheel drive
      - engine powers rear wheels
      - car weight is effectively 'pushed' forward
      - car has tendency to oversteer if too much throttle is used
        - which means it's easy to lose control and spin out
      - the key to tame RWD car is to be gentle with throttle, especially while turning
    - front-wheel drive
      - engine powers front wheels
      - car weight is effectively 'pulled' forward
      - car has tendency to understeer
        - since ront wheels are used for both turning and moving forward, FWD car doesn't turn as effectively as RWD car
        - understeering can be mitigated by using handbrake and throttling at once, forcing rear wheels to slide
    - all-wheel drive
      - both front and read wheels are powered by the engine
      - combine the best from both worlds, typically the easiest to control
      - engine placement, and thus weight balance, decides if the car behaves more like FWD or RWD car
      - understanding weight transfer and tapping handbrake can be used to affect car behavior
  - by engine placement
    - this characteristic doesn't do much on its own, but it affects how car behaves depending on its drive type
    - engine is typically the heaviest part of the car and thus it significantly affects weight distribution
      - front engine - engine block is placed in front of the driver
      - mid engine - engine block placed behind the front seats
      - rear engine - engine block placed close to rear wheels of the car
  - know the characteristics of your car before starting the race
    - have a certain mental image in your head about where the engine is placed, which wheels are powered and how the car behaves
    - apply throttle accordingly
- use controller vibration to evaluate behavior of your car
  - that way you don't have to engage your sight for that, easier to stay focused on the road
  - throttle and brake just enough to not block tyres or make them spin
    - even if there's no punishment for locking your wheels, you still risk losing control over your car if you break or accelearate too heavily
  - look at the furthest point you can see
    - always be in look for the next turn and be ready to brake
- learn the circuit and follow racing lines
  - for sharp turns, it's usually beneficial to brake early and place your car on the outer side of the turn
  - in most cases it's better to brake too early rather than too late (unless you're fighting for the position)
    - braking too late and hitting a barrier nearly always costs you time
- the faster you go, the more delicate you should be while steering
  - frantic corrections with your steering wheel can cause your car to spin out
  - a lot of simcade games reduce the effect of the above
    - if you play any Forza Horizon title, compare normal and simulation steering by driving any car fast and moving your wheel left and right quickly. Only in one of those two cases you're nearly guaranteed to lose control
- play time trials for practice if your game allows for that
  - there's a lot of difference between regular racing and hot-lapping
  - playing time trials on a selected circuit will enable you to develop muscle memory, learn where and how much you ought to brake or turn and where you should place your car to go through each turn in an optimal way
- learn to launch your car properly while starting the race
  - different games have different launch sequences. Great launch can buy you a few extra places
  - in some games it's not enough to just push throttle to the max and hope for the best
  - some games (like Mario Kart) have very specific launch sequence that grants additional boost if done correctly
