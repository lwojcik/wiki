# Racing games

- there are a few kinds of racing games:
  - simulators
    - typically played with a racing wheel and pedals
    - containing detailed car physics
    - difficult to play with a console controller
    - popular racing simulators: Project CARS, iRacing, Asetto Corsa
  - 'simcades'
    - somewhere between simulators and arcade racing games
    - they still contain mechanisms from simulators (tuning, physics, etc.) but they are more forgiving to beginners
    - simplified steering physics which makes those games perfectly playable with a console controller
    - assists, like traction control, ABS or assisted braking are available
  - arcade racing games
    - there's nearly nothing realistic about their racing model
    - vehicle physics is intended to promote risky driving with plenty of room for error
    - don't have to involve cars
    - easiest to learn for beginners
    - they often ditch the notion of 'realistic' car racing and introduce new elements not present in other sub-genres
    - notable arcade racing games: most Need for Speed titles, Mario Kart, F-Zero, The Crew 2
      - racing elements of GTA V place it in an arcade racing game category
      - even Red Dead Redemption contains arcade racing elements but that doesn't make it a racing franchise :)
