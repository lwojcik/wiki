# Forza Horizon

Arcade racing video game franchise started in 2012, developed by Playground Games.

A spin-off from more serious, yet still arcade-ish Forza Motorport series, which features races on closed circuit tracks.

First two Forza Horizon installments were available only on Xbox 360 and Xbox One. Forza Horizon 3 and later are available on PC as well.

Starting from Forza Horizon 4, all titles are available either via Microsoft Store (buying on this platform makes the game possible to play either on PC or on Xbox) or via Steam.

## Personal notes

- I was 'infected' with Forza Horizon franchise on [blu's Twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/blu_fall)
- the franchise 'clicked' to me because I played a lot of The Crew 2 at the time
- I played all installments in the following order: 4, 3, 5, 1, 2
- Forza Horizon 4 was the installment I played super seriously, including placing myself in top 50 in rivals events. The remaining installments, including the latest one, I play for fun, often with friends
- I love car racing and this franchise brings all the awesomeness I first discovered in Need for Speed: World (open world crusising, various racing events to choose from, selection of fun cars, etc.)
- it's not a franchise you play for racing. I call it Magic the Gathering with cars
  - if you don't like racing, there's plenty of things to do that aren't racing per se, but still involve doing _something_ with cars
