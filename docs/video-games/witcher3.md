# The Witcher 3

- I like to say I'm the only Pole that didn't enjoy this game
- I never read Andrzej Sapkowski's books, unlikely to do that anytime soon
- don't get me wrong, the game is objectively good and I can see that
  - I also respect CD Projekt RED for porting it to Nintendo Switch
    - making a game of this magnitude work on a 2017 smartphone is a big deal in my book
- But to me, it didn't age well
  - graphics looks outdated to the point I pay attention to it
  - after Red Dead Redemption 2 riding a horse felt weird
  - controls are unintuitive and complicated
  - why the hell Geralt needs two different swords for different things?
    - even if there's explanation for that, I found that mechanic annoying
- the game consistently fails to get me hooked within first 2-3 hours
  - believe me, I tried three times so far
- [with a few expections, I just don't like fantasy](https://offbeatbits.com/4-months-in-hyrule-but-is-the-world-my-oyster/#i-dont-like-fantasy-games)
