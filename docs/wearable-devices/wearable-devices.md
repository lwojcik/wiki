# Wearable devices

Class of electronic devices that are designed to wear as part of clothing or an accessory, excluding headsets, portable music players and a few others. They may share or derive their roots from [mobile devices](/mobile-devices/), but in my opinion they are significant enough to form a separate category.

Typically, I think of wearable devices as tiny specialized computers designed to do a highly specialized limited set of things while being more lightweight and compact than smartphones.

The most archetypic wearable devices in my mind are smartwatches and smartbands.

## Wearable devices I currently use
