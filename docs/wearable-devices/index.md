# Wearable devices

Class of electronic devices that are designed to wear as part of clothing or an accessory, excluding headsets, portable music players and a few others. They may share or derive their roots from [mobile devices](/mobile-devices/), but in my opinion they are significant enough to form a separate category.

Typically, I think of wearable devices as tiny specialized computers designed to do a highly specialized limited set of things while being more lightweight and compact than smartphones.

The most archetypic wearable devices in my mind are smartwatches and smartbands.

## Personal notes

- I don't like the fact they're merely computers with a mediocre battery. Only Pebble Time was awesome enough to hold 1 week on a single charge
- There are times when having phone notifications on your wrist is super useful, and times when I get tired of them and get back to traditional wristwatches

## Wearable devices I currently use

It doesn't mean I wear them every day, but I still own and wear them at least occasionally.

- Xiaomi Mi Band 6 NFC

## Wearable devices I used in the past

Those are devices I no longer use and / or own.
