# Russian Invasion on Ukraine

In 2022 Russia invaded Ukraine and that started a really huge chapter in modern history, even though it was just another act of an on-going conflict initiated by a long chain of events.

It was also a recurring topic of multiple conversations with my friends, especially those who live far away from the scene, making me write whole walls of text on the topic.

This section contains my loose thoughts on how I see and think about the events.

Quite a few in Polish. My foreign friends - always try checking if subtitles are available.
