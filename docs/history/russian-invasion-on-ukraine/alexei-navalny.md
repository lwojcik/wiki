  - "Russia must recognize these borders even now"
- leave Ukraine alone and give it the opportunity to develop as its people wish
  - stop aggression, end the war and withdraw all Russian troops from the territory of Ukraine
- together with Ukraine, the United States, the European Union and Britain, look for acceptable ways to compensate for the damage caused to Ukraine
- investigate war crimes in cooperation with international institutions
- not all people in Russia have imperial views
  - citing the example of Belarus - Belarussians don't necessarily feel 'imperial' but they are ruled by a dictator

## Past political statements

- 2008: blogging on his LiveJournal about Russo-Georgian War:
  - Russia should help South Ossetia and Abkhazia
  - declare a no-fly zone over South Ossetia, shoot down any aircraft that violates it
  - declare a complete blockade of Georgia, stop any communication with them
  - expel all Georgian citizens from Russia
  - "In the future, act according to the situation, but at the same time be aware that, of course, you really want to shoot _rodents_ [the original word used here is a pejorative term for Georgians] with a cruise missile at the General Staff, but the _rodents_ are just waiting for this"
  - even according to independent EU report Georgia was blamed for starting the war, so Navalny's stance wasn't really that off
- October 2014: interview with Alexei Venediktov, editor-in-chief of the Echo of Moscow
  - given shortly after the annexation of Crimea, Russo-Ukrainian war in Donbas had already started
  - who does Crimea belong to?
    - Navalny: 'Crimea is the people who live in Crimea'
      - the peninsula "was seized with a flagrant violation of all international norms," ​​but is now part of Russia
    - advised Ukrainians not to deceive themselves: "Crimea will remain part of Russia and will never become part of Ukraine again in the foreseeable future"
  - when Navalny becomes a president of the Russian Federation, will he return Crimea to Ukraine?
    - Navalny: "Crimea is what, a sandwich with sausage to be returned here and there?"
    - in later interviews in other sources Navalny proposed organizing a fair referendum about Crimea
      - conveniently omitting the fact Crimea was illegally seized by Russian Federation
