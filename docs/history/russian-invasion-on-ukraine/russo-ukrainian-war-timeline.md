# Timeline of Russo-Ukrainian War

Events of the on-going conflict between Russia and Ukraine since the annexation of Crimea in 2014.

This is by no means a complete list. I can't say if there's a single timeline or cause and effect relationship between these events.

Some of the events may be irrelevant or unrelated.
