# Approaching news about the war

Thoughts on how I deal with information about Russo-Ukraine war.

- we're all part of an information war that started long before Russia crossed Ukrainian borders
- none of us is immune from enemy propaganda
- during the kinetic phase of war, information is no longer used only to inform the public. It also serves other purposes:
  - keep people's morale high
  - confuse or demoralize the enemy
  - achieve certain effect in on-going diplomatic efforts (e.g. convince the unconvinced that it's worth increasing efforts and expenditure)
- as general public we know only a tiny percentage of what's really happening
  - international politics and diplomacy happen behind closed doors
  - some of today's secret information will be revealed or leaked in the future when its impact will be lower
  - some news may be intentionally confusing or misleading for various reasons
    - example: US President Joe Biden's visit to Poland in February 2023
      - until the very last moment only a few people knew president would visit Kyiv, official sources were in denial
- only official government channels are credible sources of first-party information
  - they may not be telling everything they know or tell 100% truth all the time though
- enemy's media cannot be treated as verifiable or trusted
  - as proved by many analysts, Russian media often engages in painting alternate versions of reality to mislead its own population
- YouTubers and content creators who weren't covering history, political topics or warfare before February 2022 aren't credible sources of information
  - In February 2022 many channels engaged in everyday war news reporting
    - including quite a few unqualified ones that smelled a popular topic to monetize and spread uncorroborated or intentionally misleading information
- as of 2023 the conflict is happening on multiple levels and there's no single winning or losing side. Changes on maps and army movements alone are of limited significance to the war as a whole; they happen within wider strategical and political context and we know just a tiny fraction of it
- no commenting or photographing any allied military vehicles you see in the area
  - silence saves lives
- no questioning or second-guessing decisions made by allied governments or army forces in public. Spreading doubt and fear is within enemy's interest. And nobody wants to hear your opinions anyway
  - you can have them, but that doesn't mean you have to post them on social media for controversy and attention. People are tired of reading the news already
  - if they call you a Russian troll on the internet, they may be right. All they can see is your statements that are in line with the enemy's propaganda. Back off. Neither you nor them can prove each other wrong.
- Russian population has been living under hard dictatorship for decades and that heavily affects the way they behave. Don't be too quick to judge 
  - Russia had democratic periods in the past but it is not by any means a democracy
  - there's no such thing as general public polls
  - people are just scared of telling the truth that is not in line with Kremlin propaganda
  - some of them may have been brainwashed to support their state simply because they want to survive
  - apart from Moscow and maybe Saint Petersburg people may not even care that much about politics because they live in poverty, struggling to make ends meet
  - unless the person explicitly expresses support for Putin's regime, they have little say about what their government has been doing. No need to give them hard time for that
