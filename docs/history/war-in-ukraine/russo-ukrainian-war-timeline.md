# Timeline of Russo-Ukrainian War

Events of the on-going conflict between Russia and Ukraine since the annexation of Crimea in 2014.

This is by no means a complete list. I can't say if there's a single timeline or cause and effect relationship between these events.

Some of the events may be irrelevant or unrelated.

## Timeline

- February 2014 - Russia annexes Crimea and Sevastopol
  - soldiers without military insignias ("little green men") show up to seaze control over Crimea
- March 2014 - The Crimean status referendum. Voters are asked if they want to rejoin Russia as federal subject
  - Official (disputed) results:
    - Crimea: 97% votes for integration with Russia, 83% voter turnout
    - Sevastopol: 95% votes for integration with Russia, 89% voter turnout
- (under construction)
