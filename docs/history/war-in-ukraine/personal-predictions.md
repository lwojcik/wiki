# Personal predictions

I don't know anything for sure. I can just speculate.

Nothing about this conflict is logical.

## Things I'm moderately certain of

- Russia won't win the war, either militarily or politically, for as long as:
  - NATO keeps supporting Ukraine
  - no other country joins Russian side
- the war will end as soon as Russia depletes its military personnel
  - their current strategy is to send as many poorly armed soldiers as possible without the regard for their own losses or army morale
  - Ukraine has less people and they can't follow that strategy
    - and I'm not sure if ALL Ukrainians would support that at all - not everyone wants to or should be a soldier at all
  - perhaps that's not a problem at all if you have enough modern military equipment
- NATO won't send military personnel to Ukraine for as long as:
  - Russia openly attacks any other NATO country
  - if that is bound to happen (or is happening right now?), general public won't know about that immediately
- whether Ukraine wins the war is not much of relevance
  - of course I wish they retain control over all of their territory, including the separatist ones, but I'm not sure if that's what's going to happen
  - moral and poltical victory doesn't change the fact Ukraine will have to spend a lot of money and labor to rebuild their country
  - the world - at least Europe - will be morally obligated to help Ukraine get back to shape
  - there will be strong pressure on Russia to pay reparations
    - either in cash or resources
    - Russian economy probably won't handle that well
  - it's gonna take even 40-50 years to get the country back to its pre-2022 state
    - whole generations of Ukrainian people will be traumatized in the process
- Russia won't turn into democracy overnight even if Putin dies
  - institutions like FSB or army have a lot of political power and they will have a say on who becomes their next leader
  - Russian opposition is pretty much irrelevant for the time being
    - I doubt they'll manage to trigger any meaningful change
    - even if they do, there's no guarantee they'll indeed be any _better_
      - I don't know who exactly opposition leaders are (e.g. Navalny) and what their exact endgame is
- other countries, especially China, have influenced the war outcome in subtle ways but as a general public we don't know that officially
- nuclear weaponry is scary, but its real purpose is to keep the other side from doing stupid things. Everyone loses if even one nuclear missile is launched
- in case of war spreading over NATO countries, US impact may be limited
  - they're on the other side of a huge puddle called the Atlantic Ocean and they need time to transport military equipment to Europe
  - US aircraft carriers may not be able to reach all European waters
    - Baltic Sea, for example, is said to be way too shallow for aircraft carries to operate

## Things I don't know yet

A few selected people in the world know the answers already. General public will learn in the future. Or not.

- can Russia use their nuclear weaponry _at all_, i.e. is it functional
  - if it's functional - since launching a missile is an operation that requires more than one operator to execute - will all personnel obey the order
- can NATO detect and effectively intercept Russian intercontinental missiles on time
- what's the real stance of China and what's their desired outcome of war
  - I think their endgame is economic dominance and they need other countries to sell them stuff; doesn't matter if it's Russia or Europe
  - they don't play well with the USA on political terms
  - war always creates economic opportunites for the selected few
- will Belarus send their military personnel to join the Russian side
  - Belarus is clearly on Russian side, they allow Russia to use their territory
  - Lukashenko is merely Putin's puppetbut he's _still_ a powerful dictator in his country
  - Belarussian opposition is stronger than the Russian one
    - people much less brainwashed with propaganda
- does NATO send as much help to Ukraine as it can
  - some wealthy European countries seem donate offensively low amounts of aid compared to other, smaller countries
  - however, official data might be misleading
- will NATO keep extending the scope of their help or is there a hard limit
  - so far there has been moments when NATO members expressed resistance against sending tanks, HIMARS and other various new types of armament to Ukraine
  - but later, they would eventually agree
  - but will the same happen with aircraft or other types of equipment I haven't heard of yet?
- will the USA make Europe repay for their help
  - Europe wasn't the biggest concern for the US politics (Taiwan is just as important and US can't be in two places at once), yet they responded with HUGE amount of financial and military help
  - American taxpayers are perfectly right to demand Europe solve their own problems with their own money rather than always relying on US army leading the way
- what's the real stance of Turkey
  - they may have great PR as the producer of Bayraktar drones
  - but they _still_ have their own policy to may not be compatible with what NATO or EU wants
    - e.g. opposing Finland and Sweden join NATO without meeting their demands
      - [talks are in progress](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/turkeys-nato-talks-with-sweden-finland-resume-march-9-2023-02-27/)
- what's the real stance of Hungary
  - despite being a NATO and EU member Hungarian government behaves very passively as if they supported the war but they were too scared to admit it publicly and I find it disgusting
    - [Orbán doesn't want to send aid to Ukraine](https://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-vetoes-ukraine-aid-eu-seeks-alternative-solution/)
      - Orbán clearly seems to be a silent ally of Putin
      - there may be more economic rationale behind that but I'm not aware of that
  - as a Pole I have a lot of good feelings about Hungarians in general, we have history of great relationship
    - but what Orbán is doing (or what he refuses to do) is incredibly dubious and head-scratching
