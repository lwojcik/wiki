# Personal predictions

I don't know anything for sure. I can just speculate. And nearly everything here can be wrong as well.

Nothing about this conflict is logical.

## Things I'm moderately certain of

- Russia won't win the war, either militarily or politically, for as long as:
  - NATO keeps supporting Ukraine
  - no other country joins Russian side
- the war will end as soon as Russia depletes its military personnel
  - their current strategy is to send as many poorly armed soldiers as possible without the regard for their own losses or army morale
  - Ukraine has less people and they can't follow that strategy
    - and I'm not sure if ALL Ukrainians would support that at all - not everyone wants to or should be a soldier at all
  - perhaps that's not a problem at all if you have enough modern military equipment
- NATO won't send military personnel to Ukraine for as long as Russia doesn't openly attack any other NATO country
  - if NATO soldiers show up in Ukraine (or if it's happening right now at all?), general public won't know about that immediately
- whether Ukraine wins the war or not is a question of medium relevance, there are more important ones to answer
  - of course I wish they retain control over all of their territories - including the separatist one - but I'm not sure if that's what's going to happen
  - moral and poltical victory doesn't change the fact Ukraine will spend a lot of money and labor to rebuild their country
  - the world - at least Europe - will be morally obligated to help Ukraine get back to shape
  - there will be strong pressure on Russia to pay reparations
    - either in cash or resources
    - Russian economy probably won't handle that well
  - it's gonna take even 40-50 years to get Ukraine back to its pre-2022 state
    - whole generations of Ukrainian people will be traumatized in the process
- Russia won't turn into democracy overnight even if Putin dies
  - institutions like FSB or army have a lot of political power and they will have a say on who becomes their next leader
  - Russian opposition is pretty much irrelevant for the time being
    - I doubt they'll manage to trigger any meaningful change
    - even if they do, there's no guarantee they'll indeed be any _better_
      - I don't know who exactly opposition leaders are (e.g. Navalny) and what their exact endgame is
- other countries, especially China, have influenced the war outcome in subtle ways but as a general public we don't know that officially
- nuclear weaponry is scary, but its real purpose is to keep the other side from doing stupid things. Everyone loses if even one nuclear missile is launched
- in case of war spreading over NATO countries, US military impact in Europe may be limited
  - they're on the other side of a huge puddle called the Atlantic Ocean and they need time to transport military equipment to Europe
  - US aircraft carriers may not be able to reach all European waters
    - Baltic Sea, for example, is said to be way too shallow for aircraft carries to operate
  - at the same time, China may use that opportunity to seize control over Taiwan
    - and that's another big thing for the USA to worry about
  - for now we live in a world where the notion of 'guarantees' is used
    - however, the fact something has to be explicitly 'guaranteed' means there's a chance it may not be delivered
    - adversaries test those 'guarantees' by sending their aircraft or ships close to strategically important areas and seeing what response is triggered
    - even a country as big and affluent as the USA may not be able to handle two major war theaters (Europe and Taiwan) at once
      - and if I didn't say that earlier, I doubt Europe is their number one priority

## Things I don't know yet

A few selected people in the world know the answers already. General public will learn in the future. Or not.

- can Russia use their nuclear weaponry _at all_, i.e. is it functional
  - if it's functional - since launching a missile is an operation that requires more than one operator to execute - will all personnel obey the order
- can NATO detect and effectively intercept Russian intercontinental missiles on time
- what's the real stance of China and what's their desired outcome of war
  - I think their endgame is economic dominance and they need other countries to sell stuff to them
    - it doesn't matter if it's Russia or Europe
  - they don't play well with the USA on political terms
    - see Donald Trump banning TikTok
    - or Huawei losing access to Google Play Store
  - war always creates economic opportunites for the selected few. And China may belong to them
- will Belarus send their military personnel to join Russians
  - Belarus is clearly on Russian side, they allow Russia to use their territories for missile strikes
  - Lukashenko is merely Putin's puppet but he's _still_ a powerful dictator in his country
  - Belarussian opposition is stronger than the Russian one
    - people much less brainwashed with propaganda
    - but that doesn't mean they have it easier
- is NATO sending as much help to Ukraine as it possibly can
  - some wealthy European countries seem donate offensively low amounts of aid compared to other, smaller countries
  - however, official data might be misleading
- will NATO keep extending the scope of their help or is there a hard limit
  - so far there has been moments when NATO members expressed resistance against sending tanks, HIMARS and other various new types of armament to Ukraine
  - but later, they would eventually say yes
  - will the same happen with aircraft or other types of equipment I haven't heard of yet?
- will the USA ask Europe to repay for their help
  - Europe wasn't the biggest concern for the US politics (Taiwan is just as important and US can't be in two places at once), yet they responded with HUGE amount of financial and military help
  - American taxpayers are perfectly right to demand Europe solve their own problems with their own money rather than always relying on the USA
- what's the real stance of Turkey
  - they may have great PR as the producer of Bayraktar drones
  - but they _still_ have their own policy to may not be compatible with what NATO or EU wants
    - e.g. opposing Finland and Sweden join NATO without meeting their demands
      - [talks are in progress](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/turkeys-nato-talks-with-sweden-finland-resume-march-9-2023-02-27/)
- what's the real stance of Hungary
  - despite being a NATO and EU member Hungarian government behaves very passively as if they supported the war but they were too scared to admit it publicly and I find it disgusting
    - [Orbán doesn't want to send aid to Ukraine](https://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-vetoes-ukraine-aid-eu-seeks-alternative-solution/)
      - Orbán clearly seems to be a silent ally of Putin
      - there may be more economic rationale behind that but I'm not aware of that
  - as a Pole I have a lot of good feelings about Hungarians in general, we have history of great relationship
    - but what Orbán is doing (or what he refuses to do) is incredibly dubious and head-scratching
- what the heck Vatican and Pope are doing
  - by staying passive and refusing to clearly condemn one side Pope effectively supports the attacking side
  - it is not unusual to see Vatican being involved in international politics
    - e.g. pope John Paul II played a huge role in democratic changes in Europe in 20th century
  - so why is Pope Francis playing as if he was a Putin ally?
