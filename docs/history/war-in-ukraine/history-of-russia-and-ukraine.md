# History of Russia and Ukraine

My attempt to note down all significant events around Russia and Ukraine leading to Russian aggression on Ukraine in 2022. Still under construction.

This is by no means a complete list. I can't say if there's a single timeline or cause and effect relationship between these events.

Some of the events may be unrelated.
