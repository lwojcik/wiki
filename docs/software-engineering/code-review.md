# Code review

Code review is a process intended to ensure better software quality in which one or few people look at source code and share ideas for improvement.

It is a common practice in companies where teams of engineers work simultaneously on a single application.

## Why code review is a thing

- We are engineers. We are software developers. We are craftsmen
- Our company hires us to build software
  - And we're expected to do it in professional way to the best of our ability
- We build software that is less or more directly related to company's revenue
  - It is within our interest to help our company become or stay profitable for as long as possible
  - ...because we want paychecks. We have families to feed. Mortgages to pay. We work to provide to ourselves and our closed ones
  - And our company is more profitable if we build software that is reliable, resilient to errors, well designed and engineered
- ...but we are also HUMANS
  - we make mistakes
  - we have biases and personal preferences
  - we are smart in our own unique ways
    - each person knows something the rest of the team doesn't
- software we build for our company doesn't belong to us
  - it functions as a solution to a specific business problem
  - if we develop particular piece of software, there's no guarantee we will maintain it
    - other team may take it over from us for further maintenance
    - we are obliged to build software according to existing company standards
    - and it is expected from us to create this kind of standards if they are non-existent
