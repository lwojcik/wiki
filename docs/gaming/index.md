This is a meta section that links everything related to games in my life.

I play video games since having [my first computer](../computers/atari-65xe/) in early 1990s. I had various breaks due to lack of access to gaming hardware, but I generally never stopped.

For many years desktop PC was my primary gaming platform. These days I use various gaming consoles.

I enjoy tabletop and card-based games too but I don't play them often enough to discuss.
