# ðŸŽ® Gaming

This is a meta section that links everything related to games in my life.

I play video games since having [my first computer](../computers/atari-65xe/) in early 1990s. I had various breaks due to lack of access to gaming hardware.

For many years desktop PC was my primary gaming platform. Between 2021 and 2024 I owned Nintendo Switch and Xbox Series X.

These days my interest in gaming is rather passive. I prefer spending time with other forms of entertainment.
