# Hello there! üëã

I'm [≈Åukasz](https://lukaszwojcik.net/) and this is my personal wiki. I use it to take notes and catalog stuff I know, want to know, or find interesting.

Think of it as my note-taking app, digital brain or a collection of ideas at various stages of development.

I maintain it in the open because at some point stuff I've learnt in my life was once openly available for everyone to use. I want to keep this circle going.

## Purpose of this wiki

I use this wiki to:

- catalog the known knowns - I share what I know and I can teach others, as well as point out valuable resources to facilitate deep diving into the topics
- catalog the known unknowns - I share incomplete and underdeveloped notes on stuff that picked my interest with the intention to learn more about it over time
- catalog the unknown knowns - I try to get back to fundamentals of what I know and pinpoint the starting point for learning any new thing
- immortalize various historical tidbits about me, my life and history as I saw it
- share personal opinions and beliefs on topics that leave room for personal tastes, discussion or speculation. Nothing about my beliefs is set in stone but I cannot expect meaningful evolution of my opinions if I don't know what exactly I stand for.
- to effectively replace my browser's bookmark bar and note-taking app, both of which I find ineffective at what I want to achieve with them
- spark other people's curiosity about stuff I'm curious about
- answer questions about what I know to people who are interested in knowing what I know
- put online what cannot fit [my blog](https://offbeatbits.com/), which is more focused on narratives than organizing notes
- challenge the idea that modern web has to be inevitably 'corporate'. Instead, I use this is wiki to acknowledge and demonstrate [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) and [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) as valid ways of thinking about owning your content on the web

## Inspiration

I started this project in February 2023 after searching for irrelevant information on some technical topic, and stumbling upon [Nikita Voloboev's personal wiki](wiki.nikiv.dev/). I've been familiar with the idea of personal wikis for a long time, but it was the first moment when it 'clicked' in my head. I was enamored with the idea and impressed with Nikita's wiki having amassed 1000+ notes on assorted topics. I suddenly realized this may be a good solution to my ever-lasting problem of [hoarding knowledge from all over the web and letting it rot](https://offbeatbits.com/the-quest-for-purging-my-bookmarks/).

For a while I saw the power and significance of what I, due to lack of better term, call **mega-homepages**, like the ones ran by [Ken Rockwell](https://kenrockwell.com/) or [Richard Stallman](https://stallman.org/). I view them as a specific type of personal websites that are very heavily focused on content, contain vast specialized knowledge bases and still retain a lot of personality of their authors. That form wasn't something I could effectively replicate myself, but this wiki gets quite close to it.

Another inspiration was the idea of [digital gardens](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). I discovered for the first time on [Simon Dann's website](https://photogabble.co.uk/glossary/growth/). While I'm still in the process of learning and understanding what exactly this idea means beyond putting fancy seedling icons next to your articles, it deeply resonates with how I think of the process of learning, organizing stuff and developing ideas.

This wiki is part of my early-2023 shift in thinking about what I want to do: I decided I no longer needed to build more new things that would require maintenance. But I'd love to spark people's curiosity, encourage them to grow, learn and explore, so that _others_ start building new things.
