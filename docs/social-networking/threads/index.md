# Threads

Threads is a proprietary social media platform built by Meta (aka Facebook) and derived from Instagram.

Available only via mobile apps.

Profile viewing is possible via web browser. URL format: `www.threads.net/@username`. Example: [Netflix](https://www.threads.net/@netflix)  

Currently not available in the European Union (viewing profile is possible).

ActivityPub support (e.g. interoperability with Mastodon) is planned.
