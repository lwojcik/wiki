# Books

Medium for recording information in written form, typically separated into pages.

For notes on Polish books I read, see the section ðŸ‘‰ [KsiÄ…Å¼ki](../pl/ksiazki/index.md)

## Personal notes

- I don't have preference about books vs e-books, I love both formats for different things
  - Paper books look nice on the shelf
  - Kindle is magnitudes more lightweight than all the books it can store
- I read in English or in Polish
  - English strongly preferred even though I need more time and focus to read English books
  - Polish translations are sometimes of mixed quality
- I strongly prefer non-fiction over fiction
  - I no longer read as much fiction as used to in 2000s
- I prefer science-fiction over fantasy
  - I find fantasy and medieval stories generally boring
  - science fiction deals with aspects of reality that MAY happen someday in the future. It's a nice thought exercise
- I like biographies
- I like well-researched guides and essays
- with certain exceptions, I don't believe in books as medium for learning technical stuff
  - for certain areas technology moves too fast for books to stay relevant
